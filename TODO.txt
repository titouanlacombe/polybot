add GPT-3 api call (try to generate the next message (with author)) {
	extract all history into log, fine tune gpt-3 on it? convert emojis to text? remove links? add joke score
	For English text, 1 token is approximately 4 characters
	TRAINING: 0.0030 / 1K tokens
	USAGE: 0.0120 / 1K tokens

	read openai docs

	activate when message is posted, and rand < small chance
	create joke entry on message id
	on each reaction increase or decrease score according to rules
	also create jokes when someone get successfull message
	scrapper command to get all old jokes & fill db

	when asking gpt-3 present most & least successfull jokes with score and ask to create new one
}
