separate services into their own repos {
    change stable diffusion to workers pulling SQL DB to get jobs and return results

    services:
    - polybot: you know, keep api (behind DNS) for mobile application project, better RPC without flask proxy?
	- api: flask? api with simple SQL DB to manage jobs, authentification ? nginx proxy. {
		- phpmyadmin: (optional, search for better alternatives)
		- nginx: proxy to api & serving static files
		- api: flask app with SQL DB
		- db: mysql or mariadb or postgresql (search for better alternatives)
	}
    - workers: docker image with api host env

	polybot and api will be on the same server (polybot in private network)

    api db:
    - users: name, passwd_hash
    - jobs: user_id, input, output

    how to make SQL non sorting collumns?

add GPT-3 api call (try to generate the next message (with author))

make simple async rpc server/client library
use that python library to implement that between polybot and api

buy RTX 3060 ti (7.5 it/s) ?

TO TEST:
more robust user management (no usernames use ids)
